#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview

**Restaurant Reviews** is a mobile-ready web application with offline storage capabilities. Users are able to favorite local restaurants and read the reviews posted by other users. Users are also free to submit their own reviews if they wish. Any changes made offline, such as favoriting a new restaurant, or uploading a new review, will be sent to the server once the user achieves an internet connection once again. 

## How to Run
Run 'npm install' and 'bower install' first and then launch the application with 'gulp serve'. To get the server up and running, please download the server from mws-restaurant-stage-3 and follow the instructions in the attached README.
